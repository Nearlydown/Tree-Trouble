//: # Binary Search Trees
//: In the world of computer science, a high level of efficiency is expected and demanded when designing an algorithm. One of the most famous data structures employed for this use is the [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). In this playground, youâ€™ll learn how binary search trees work by making one yourself!

//: ## How Do They Work?
//: Each tree is made up of several interconnected nodes (represented as circles) that contain a value. Each node can have zero or one parent nodes (nodes connected above a node), and zero to two child nodes (connected below).

var bst = BinarySearchTree<Int>(value:/*#-editable-code root node*/20/*#-end-editable-code*/)

//: Add nodes into the tree!
bst.insert(value: /*#-editable-code number*//*#-end-editable-code*/)
bst.insert(value: /*#-editable-code number*//*#-end-editable-code*/)

bst.insert(value: /*#-editable-code number*//*#-end-editable-code*/)

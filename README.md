# Tree Trouble
>An interactive Swift Playground Book about Binary Search Trees, designed for the Swift Playgrounds application on the iPad. 
This is my personal entry for the WWDC 2017 scholarship application. The book is a simple, responsive tutorial with a 
game on the last page. You will help create, insert nodes, and traverse your own Binary Search Tree using the Swift coding 
language.

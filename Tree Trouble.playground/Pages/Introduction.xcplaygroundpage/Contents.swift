//: # Binary Search Trees
//: In the world of computer science, a high level of efficiency is expected and demanded when designing an algorithm. One of the most famous data structures employed for this use is the [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). In this playground, youâ€™ll learn how binary search trees work by making one yourself!

//: ## How Do They Work?
//: Each tree is made up of several interconnected nodes (represented as circles) that contain a value. Each node can have zero or one parent nodes (nodes connected above a node), and zero to two child nodes (connected below). Each left child is less than its parent, and each right child is greater.
